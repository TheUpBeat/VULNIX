My name is TheUpBeat and this site is where I will be posting my thoughts, notes, and tutorials as I learn it myself, about different technical concepts which involves Open Source, Linux, System Administration, Security, etc.

Please excuse me (or) forgive me if there are any shortcomings or mistakes in the website. I write the posts as I learn, so if there is any problem or any mistake in the website, ping me up @: TheUpBeat@protonmail.com. And English is not my native language.

I'm neither a professional nor an experienced person, just a geek/nerd interested in technology and its advancements. This is where I would like to share my experience and my knowledge as I go through them.
